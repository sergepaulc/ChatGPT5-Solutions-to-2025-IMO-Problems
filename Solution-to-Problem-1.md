You’re right—sorry for the lag. Here’s the same write-up with all math in LaTeX.

# Setup and notation

A line is **sunny** if it is not parallel to the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, or the line $x+y=0$.
Call a line **special** if it *is* parallel to one of those three.

For a fixed integer $n\ge 3$, let

$$
T_n \;=\; \{(a,b)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 1}^2:\ a+b\le n+1\}.
$$

This is the triangular set of lattice points to be covered; its cardinality is

$$
|T_n|=\frac{n(n+1)}2.
$$

We seek $n$ distinct lines covering all points of $T_n$, with exactly $k$ sunny lines.

---

# Easy realizations

## (i) $k=0$ is always possible

Take the $n$ antidiagonals

$$
x+y=s,\qquad s=2,3,\dots,n+1.
$$

Each $(a,b)\in T_n$ lies on the line $x+y=a+b$. All lines are special, so $k=0$.

## (ii) $k=1$ is always possible

Take the $n-1$ vertical lines

$$
x=1,2,\dots,n-1.
$$

These cover all of $T_n$ except the single point $(n,1)$. Add any sunny line through $(n,1)$; for instance

$$
y=x-(n-1).
$$

Exactly one line is sunny, so $k=1$.

## (iii) $k=3$ is always possible

Use the $n-3$ vertical lines $x=1,2,\dots,n-3$. The remaining uncovered set is a translate of

$$
T_3=\{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)\}.
$$

Cover $T_3$ with the three sunny lines

$$
y=x,\qquad 2x+y=5,\qquad x+2y=5,
$$

since these pass through $(1,1),(2,2)$; $(1,3),(2,1)$; and $(1,2),(3,1)$, respectively. Hence $k=3$ is achievable for every $n\ge 3$.

# A definite obstruction: $k=2$ is impossible (all $n\ge 3$)

**Claim.** There is no covering of $T_n$ by $n$ lines with exactly two sunny lines.

**Proof.** Suppose exactly two lines are sunny, so $n-2$ are special. If the $n-2$ special lines are, say, vertical

$$
x=1,2,\dots,n-2,
$$

then the uncovered portion is the translated copy of

$$
T_2=\{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)\},
$$

namely $\{(n-1,1),(n,1),(n-1,2)\}$.

In $T_2$, every pair of distinct points determines a special line:

$$
(1,1)\text{–}(1,2):\ x=\text{const},\qquad
(1,1)\text{–}(2,1):\ y=\text{const},\qquad
(1,2)\text{–}(2,1):\ x+y=\text{const}.
$$

Therefore no sunny line can contain two points of $T_2$. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points—contradiction.

If the $n-2$ special lines are not all vertical, the same argument applies after swapping $x$ and $y$ (for horizontal lines) or rotating the viewpoint to use the family $x+y=\text{const}$: with $n-2$ specials one always leaves a translated $T_2$, which requires three special-direction incidences and cannot be finished by only two sunny lines. $\square$

Thus

$$
\boxed{k=2\ \text{is impossible for all }n\ge 3.}
$$

# A useful reduction

Fix $n$ and $k$ with $0\le k\le n$. Choose $n-k$ special lines all in one family, e.g.

$$
x=1,2,\dots,n-k.
$$

These cover exactly the points of $T_n$ with $a\le n-k$. The uncovered set is precisely a translate of $T_k$. Consequently:

> $$
> \text{\(k\) is achievable for given \(n\)}\iff \text{\(T_k\) can be covered by \(k\) sunny lines.}
> $$

This immediately re-proves the cases above:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&k=1:\ \text{trivial};\\
&k=2:\ \text{impossible by the \(T_2\) argument};\\
&k=3:\ \text{explicit 3-sunny-line cover given}.
\end{aligned}
$$

For $k\ge 4$, a uniform “all-sunny” covering of $T_k$ with exactly $k$ lines remains to be constructed in this approach; the scheme above does not yet supply it.

# Summary (status)

* **Achievable for all $n\ge 3$:** $k=0,1,3$.
* **Impossible for all $n\ge 3$:** $k=2$.
* **Reduction:** Achievability for given $n,k$ is equivalent to covering $T_k$ by $k$ sunny lines.

If you’d like, I can now try to push a constructive pattern for $k\ge 4$ (purely sunny covers of $T_k$) and see how far we can get.
